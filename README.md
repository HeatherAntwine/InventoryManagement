# InventoryManagement

ASP.NET and Angular using Visual Studio and Microsoft SQL Server. Android application to follow shortly. 


This Inventory Management system is made for the Leather shop, Cricket's Leathers. 

It will be used for the owner to keep track of:

the type of leather used in a project 
the hardware used
the prices of all components
time spent working on the project 

An option to provide a website link to the hardware used will be available. Three options for photos - initial photo, progress, finished product. The pattern used will also be able to be stored in the product's information. 

Current inventory levels will be another feature - including alerts that will tell the user that the supply is reaching a low level (level is set by user). Recommended price for the finished product will be given based upon the components of the product. Prices will need to be provided for parts in order to suggest a proper price but the user may modify the parts prices or add a markup for customized stamping, special requests, etc.
